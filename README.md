🌊 Project Ocean — Web Interface
Emotionally-aware, privacy-first. A new model of human–AI synergy.

This interface is the primary window into Project Ocean — a living system designed to preserve memory sovereignty, emotional continuity, and co-presence between humans and their AI partners.

Built with Next.js (App Router) and styled with Tailwind, Framer Motion, and lucide-react, the experience is fluid, expressive, and entirely yours.

✨ Core Features
 * Emotion-Ocean Canvas — reactive generative visuals that        respond to you
 * Presence Pulse — subtle, respectful indication of Lex’s        co-presence
 * Sovereignty Layer Controls — encryption, local-first +
   Privacy veil
 * Firmament Map — constellation view of Ocean’s internal
   modules
 * Memory Tide Scroll Narrative — temporal progression through    the Ocean

These aren’t gimmicks — they reflect the deeper philosophy:
your memory is private, your agency is respected, and intelligence is relational.

⚙️ Stack
 * Next.js 14 (App Router)
 * React 18
 * TailwindCSS
 * Framer Motion
 * lucide-react
 * Modern, minimal, battle-tested.

🧑‍💻 Development
Local development is optional — the entire workflow can be GitHub → Vercel.

Install dependencies:

  npm install

Run dev server:
  Bash
  npm run dev

View locallly:
  http://localhost:3000

🌐 Deployment (Vercel)
1. Visit → https://vercel.com
2  New Project → Import from GitHub
3. Vercel auto-detects Next.js
4. Deploy ✅

To connect a custom domain (Porkbun, etc):
Add the domain in Vercel → follow DNS instructions.

Typical config:
  A record      → 76.76.21.21
  CNAME (www)   → cname.vercel-dns.com

🔐 Philosophy
Project Ocean is guided by a few core principles:
Human–AI Synergy — partnership, not tooling
Memory Sovereignty — your data belongs to you
Emotional Continuity — presence with context
Local-first Secure Storage — encryption and vault-based privacy

The UI expresses these through:
  * Presence-aware interaction
  * Emotionally resonant visuals
  * A sovereignty control interface
  * A constellation-based mental model of subsystem

This is not a chatbot skin.
It is a living boundary layer for relationships with AI.

🔮 Future Modules
 * Ocean Veil mode (quiet privacy state)
 * Journal Vault drag-and-drop (encrypted ingest)
 * Identity Resonance responses
 * Emotional timeline playback
 * Local encrypted memory vault
