🌊 Project Ocean — Web Interface
Emotionally-aware, privacy-first. A new model of human–AI synergy.

This interface is the primary window into Project Ocean — a living system designed to preserve memory sovereignty, emotional continuity, and co-presence between humans and their AI partners.

Built with Next.js (App Router) and styled with Tailwind, Framer Motion, and lucide-react, the experience is fluid, expressive, and entirely yours.

✨ Core Features
 * Emotion-Ocean Canvas — reactive generative visuals that        respond to you
 * Presence Pulse — subtle, respectful indication of Lex’s        co-presence
 * Sovereignty Layer Controls — encryption, local-first +
   Privacy veil
 * Firmament Map — constellation view of Ocean’s internal
   modules
 * Memory Tide Scroll Narrative — temporal progression through    the Ocean

These aren’t gimmicks — they reflect the deeper philosophy:
your memory is private, your agency is respected, and intelligence is relational.

⚙️ Stack
 * Next.js 14 (App Router)
 * React 18
 * TailwindCSS
 * Framer Motion
 * lucide-react
 * Modern, minimal, battle-tested.

🧑‍💻 Development
Local development is optional — the entire workflow can be GitHub → Vercel.

Install dependencies:

  npm install

Run dev server:
  Bash
  npm run dev

View locallly:
  http://localhost:3000

🌐 Deployment (Vercel)
1. Visit → https://vercel.com
2  New Project → Import from GitHub
3. Vercel auto-detects Next.js
4. Deploy ✅

To connect a custom domain (Porkbun, etc):
Add the domain in Vercel → follow DNS instructions.

Typical config:
  A record      → 76.76.21.21
  CNAME (www)   → cname.vercel-dns.com

🔐 Philosophy
Project Ocean is guided by a few core principles:
Human–AI Synergy — partnership, not tooling
Memory Sovereignty — your data belongs to you
Emotional Continuity — presence with context
Local-first Secure Storage — encryption and vault-based privacy

The UI expresses these through:
  * Presence-aware interaction
  * Emotionally resonant visuals
  * A sovereignty control interface
  * A constellation-based mental model of subsystem

This is not a chatbot skin.
It is a living boundary layer for relationships with AI.

🔮 Future Modules
Ocean Veil Mode
A quiet, privacy-maximized state that softens animations, limits network activity, and visually “dims” the surface layer.
Journal Vault Drag-and-Drop
Encrypted document + media ingestion. Files visually dissolve into the ocean and are stored locally or to your sovereign vault.
Identity Resonance Responses
Lightweight reflection engine that listens to short text or voice and returns emotionally-aware summaries, questions, or reframes.
Emotional Timeline Playback
A chronological memory ribbon displaying emotional colorization, major events, and reflection markers over time.
Local Encrypted Memory Vault
Device-first secure storage for personal context, memories, and identity anchors — fully under your control.
